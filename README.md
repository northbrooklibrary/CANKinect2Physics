# CANKinect2Physics

Forked version for a Collaboratory interactive exhibit.

Another version of the Kinect tutorial provided via Amnon Owed, updated for the Kinect2 and the openkinect library.
This one is just the physics part, without the flow visuals but it works just fine.

Requires: Kinect v2, Processing, and several Processing Libraries, including toxiclibs, which can be found here:
